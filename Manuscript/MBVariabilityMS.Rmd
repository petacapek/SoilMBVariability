## Introduction

Macromolecular and elemental composition of cells of single microbial-species communities is known to vary significantly [@Hanegraaf2001a; @Makino2003; @herbert1961]. As quoted by Denis Herbert, "Such a statement as 'the ribonucleic acid content of Bacillus cereus is 16.2%' is by itself as incomplete and misleading as the statement 'the boiling-point of water is 70°C'.". Variability in cell composition is primarily associated with changes in specific growth-rate (Fig. 1A, [@Hanegraaf2001], [@Herbert1961], [@Makino2003]). To grow, microbial cells require several macromolecules and metabolites with unique elemental composition ([@Vrede2004], [@Franklin2011]) that transforms consumed substrates into various cell components. Typical example of macromolecule mediating growth is ribosomal RNA, which performs translation of genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. Because the rate of translation per unit of one ribosome is constant, increase in growth rate can be achieved only by increasing the ribosomal RNA content ([@Vrede2004], [@Franklin2011]). For that reason, ribosomal RNA content typically increases with increasing specific growth-rate (Fig. 1A, [@Hanegraaf2001], [@Makino2003], [@Herbert1961]).

To describe the relationship between the growth-rate and cell composition, it proved convenient to distinguish at least two pools of cellular biomass (Fig. 1B, [@Hanegraaf2001], [@Franklin2011]). One pool represents all cell constituents that are typically present in non-growing cell. The second pool represents the macromolecules and metabolites that are associated with increased specific-growth rate ([@Hanegraaf2001], [@Franklin2011]). The terminology is not unified in respect to these pools. [@Hanegraaf2001] for example, denote these pools as "Structures" and "Reserves", respectively. [@Franklin2011] use the terms "baseline biomass" and "growth machinery" (authors also distinguish the third pool of "uptake machinery"). For convenience, we will hereafter use the terms "Basal biomass" ($B$) and "Growth intermediates" ($G$). As the specific-growth rate increases, relative abundance of $B$ decreases whereas $G$ increases (see the detail ). Defining the macromolecular content and/or elemental stoichiometry of pools $B$ and $G$ allows then to associate changes in cell composition directly to changes in specific-growth rate (Fig. 1A; [@Hanegraaf2001], [@Hanegraaf2000]). The two pools serve as a reliable abstraction of otherwise complex microbial physiology.

Soil microbial communities are characteristic by co-occurrence of many species. Given the fact that different species might have different physiological characteristics such as basal DNA or RNA content, it remains unclear if any generalizable relationship between the specific growth-rate and composition of soil microbial biomass can exist. Several indirect empirical evidences suggest that it can. By tracking the radiolabelled glucose added to soil at different concentrations, [@bremer1990] found that two pools of soil microbial biomass should be distinguished to explain variability in chloroform-labile content of microbial biomass, i.e. the $k_{ec}$ factor. The similar conclusion was later on reached by [@glanville2016]. Other studies showed that the ratio between different constituents of soil microbial biomass and chloroform-labile organic carbon (CLC) changes significantly and consistently over time or across organic substrate (typically glucose) concentrations (i.e. DNA [@Marstorp1999],[@malik2015], ATP [@tsai1997], [@joergensen2002], RNA and PLFA [@malik2015], [@gunina2017]). [@tessier1998] found a consistent relationship between the total soil organic carbon (C) content (i.e. defining the soil microbial biomass growth rate) and the $k_{ec}$ factor. Recently, [@hagerty2022] showed that considering two pools of soil microbial biomass significantly improves a simulation of microbially-explicit mathematical models.

If the generalizable relationship between the microbial biomass composition and the specific-growth rate applies to soil microbial communities, it has three important implications that are intimately connected. The first two implications are methodological. First, understanding the relationship between the microbial biomass composition and the specific-growth rate can improve the quantification of the total soil microbial biomass. Most of the methods relies on quantitative extraction of some part of microbial biomass (e.g. CLC [@Vance1987], DNA [@Marstorp1999], PLFA [@ziegler2005], ATP [@blagodatskaya2013]). Total microbial biomass is then calculated as a product of the extracted content and arbitrary defined conversion factor, which is, in many cases, assumed to be invariant even though the empirical results prove the opposite. Second, better quantification of total soil microbial biomass improves the quantification of biomass-specific physiological parameters, which rely on tracking the isotopically labelled substrates to microbial biomass, i.e. carbon use efficiency [@geyer2019; @hagerty2022] and turnover rate [@chen2019].
