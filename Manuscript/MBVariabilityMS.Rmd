## 1. Introduction

Macromolecular and elemental composition of cells of single-species microbial communities is known to vary significantly [@Hanegraaf2001; @Makino2003; @herbert1961]. As quoted by Denis Herbert, "Such a statement as 'the ribonucleic acid content of Bacillus cereus is 16.2%' is by itself as incomplete and misleading as the statement 'the boiling-point of water is 70°C'.". Variability in cell composition is primarily associated with changes in specific growth rate (Fig. 1A, @Hanegraaf2001; @Herbert1961; @Makino2003). To grow, microbial cells require several macromolecules and metabolites with unique elemental composition [@Vrede2004; @Franklin2011] that transforms consumed substrates into various cell components. Typical example of macromolecule mediating growth is ribosomal RNA, which performs translation of genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. Because the rate of translation per unit of one ribosome is constant, increase in growth rate can be achieved only by increasing the ribosomal RNA content [@Vrede2004; @Franklin2011]. For that reason, ribosomal RNA content typically increases with increasing specific growth rate (Fig. 1A, @Hanegraaf2001; @Makino2003; @Herbert1961).

To describe the relationship between the growth rate and cell composition, it proved convenient to distinguish at least two pools of microbial biomass (Fig. 1C, @Hanegraaf2001; @Franklin2011). One pool represents all cell constituents that are typically present in non-growing cell. The second pool represents the macromolecules and metabolites that are associated with increased specific growth rate [@Hanegraaf2001; @Franklin2011]. The terminology is not unified in respect to these pools. [@Hanegraaf2001] for example, denote them as "Structures" and "Reserves", respectively. [@Franklin2011] use the terms "baseline biomass" and "growth machinery" (authors also distinguish the third pool of "uptake machinery"). For convenience, we will hereafter use the terms "Basal biomass" ($B$) and "Growth intermediates" ($G$). As the specific growth rate increases, relative abundance of $B$ decreases whereas $G$ increases (see section 2.1. for detail description). Defining the macromolecular content and/or elemental stoichiometry of pools $B$ and $G$ allows then to associate changes in cell composition directly to changes in specific growth rate (Fig. 1A; @Hanegraaf2001; @Hanegraaf2000). Thus, the two pools serve as a reliable abstraction of otherwise complex microbial physiology.

Soil microbial communities are characteristic by co-occurrence of many species in the same microenvironments. Given the fact that different species might have different physiological characteristics such as basal DNA or RNA content, it remains unclear if any generalizable relationship between the specific growth rate and composition of soil microbial biomass can exist. Several indirect empirical evidences suggest that it can. By tracking the radiolabelled glucose added to soil at different concentrations, @bremer1990 found that two pools of soil microbial biomass should be distinguished to explain variability in chloroform-labile content of microbial biomass, i.e. the $k_{ec}$ factor. The similar conclusion was later on reached by @glanville2016. Other studies showed that the ratio between different macromolecules and chloroform-labile organic carbon (CLC) changes significantly and consistently over time or across organic substrate (typically glucose) concentrations (i.e. DNA @Marstorp1999; @malik2015, ATP @tsai1997; @joergensen2002, RNA and PLFA @malik2015; @gunina2017). @tessier1998 found a consistent relationship between the total soil organic carbon (C) content, which affects the growth rate of microbial biomass, and the $k_{ec}$ factor. Recently, @hagerty2022 showed that considering two pools of soil microbial biomass significantly improves a simulation accuracy of microbially-explicit mathematical models.

If the generalizable relationship between the microbial biomass composition and the specific-growth rate can be defined for soil microbial communities, it would have four important implications that are intimately linked. The first two implications are methodological. *(i)* Understanding the relationship between the microbial biomass composition and the specific growth rate can improve the quantification of the total soil microbial biomass. Most of the methods relies on quantitative extraction of some part of microbial biomass, so called biomass proxy parameter (e.g. CLC @Vance1987, DNA @Marstorp1999, PLFA @ziegler2005, ATP @blagodatskaya2013). Total microbial biomass is then calculated as a product of the proxy parameter and arbitrary defined conversion factor, which is, in many cases, assumed to be invariant even though the empirical results prove the opposite. For example, the $k_{ec}$ factor changes significantly over the course of few days [@glanville2016; @bremer1990; @santruckova2004] and may vary by a factor of up to 30 among different soils or soil depths [@sparling1989; @sparling1988; @Dictor1998]. *(ii)* Improved quantification of total soil microbial biomass improves the quantification of biomass-specific physiological parameters, such as carbon use efficiency [@geyer2019; @hagerty2022] and turnover rate [@chen2019], which emerge from the flux of the isotopically labelled substrates through total microbial biomass. *(iii)* When two commonly measured biomass proxies show consistently distinct relationship with specific-growth rate, their ratio can be used as a simple indicator of instant specific growth rate, which is otherwise very difficult to quantify. (iv) At last, improved mechanistic and quantitiative understanding of soil microbial community physiology may improve the simulation accuracy of microbially-explicit soil biogeochemical models even above the level quantified by [@hagerty2022], whose analysis sticks to the assumption of constant composition of microbial biomass.

The aim of this study is to find and define the relationship between the macromolecular composition of soil microbial biomass, and to determine its generalizability and implications. To do so, we first attempt to explain the temporal variability in $k_{ec}$ factor and ratios of different macromolecules individually as reported in previously published studies. We use a microbially-explicit mathematical model inspired by the dynamic energy budget theory [@Hanegraaf2001; @kooijman1991; @Kooijman2009]. Then, we use the model to explain the variability in all data products across all published studies using one set of model parameters. We hypothesize that defining the two pools of soil microbial biomass and their macromolecular content can explain the variability in $k_{ec}$ factor and ratios of different macromolecules. We further hypothesize that the model recognizing two pools of microbial biomass provides a generalizable abstraction of microbial physiology across different soils.

## 2. Material and Methods

### 2.1. Theory

Here we use a theory and mathematical description inspired by the Dynamic Energy Budget theory [@Hanegraaf2001; @kooijman1991; @Kooijman2009]. The mathematical formulation is, however, defined directly on per C-1 molar basis to avoid excessive number of conversion factors, and the terminology common to soil microbial studies is used. For simplicity, we assume that the microbial community is composed of heterotrophic microorganisms, volume and shape of all microbial cells doesn't change over time and it is similar across soils, the aerobic conditions dominate in all microenvironments, the catabolic reactions within the cell degrades organic substrate completely to $CO_{2}$ (i.e. release of fermentation products to soil is negligible), and the extracellular enzymes production is negligible.

The model is schematically shown on Fig. 1C (see also Tab. 1 for list of symbols and their explanation) and recognizes four different carbon pools - organic substrate ($S$) the microbial biomass feeds on, $B$, $G$, and $CO_{2}$ as a product of catabolism. Total microbial biomass ($MB$) is a sum of $B$ and $B \times G$ because $G$ is located inside the cell. $S$ is consumed by the rate proportional to $B$ (i.e. $G$ has no effect). The uptake rate ($U$) is defined as:

$U = I_m \times B \times f;~~~f = \frac{S}{K_m + S}.$ (1)

In eq. 1, $I_m$ is maximum uptake rate of a substrate and $K_M$ is half-saturation constant. Becuase $S$ is assimilated into $G$, there must be overhead costs in form of $CO_{2}$, which are assumed to be covered directly from $S$. Substrate assimilation ($A$) and assimilatory respiration ($R_{assimilatory}$) rate are respectively defined as:

$A = U \times y_A,$ (2)

and

$R_{assimilatory} = U \times (1-y_A).$ (3)

In eqs. 2 and 3, $y_A$ defines the efficiency of substrate conversion into $G$. Once the $S$ is assimilated, $G$ can be mobilized and used to either cover maintenance costs or/and to grow (i.e. produce $B$). The mobilization rate ($J$) is proportional to $G$:

$J = A_m \times \frac{G}{G_M}.$ (4)

In eq. 4, $A_m$ is biomass specific maximum assimilation rate constant, which is equal to $I_m \times y_A$. $G_m$ is maximum content of $G$ that the cell can have. Thus, the more substrate the cell assimilates, the faster the $G$ can be mobilized. $G$ content cannot exceed $G_m$, so $\frac{G}{G_m}$ is always a number between 0 and 1. When $\frac{G}{G_m}$ is 1, $J$ reaches the maximum under the given environmental conditions.

At any time, microbial cell has to maintain its integrity.
