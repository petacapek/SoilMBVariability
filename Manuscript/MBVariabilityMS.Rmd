## Introduction

Macromolecular and elemental composition of cells of single microbial-species communities is known to vary significantly ([@Hanegraaf2001], [@Makino2003], [@Herbert1961]). As quoted by Denis Herbert, "Such a statement as 'the ribonucleic acid content of Bacillus cereus is 16.2%' is by itself as incomplete and misleading as the statement 'the boiling-point of water is 70°C'.". Variability in cell composition is primarily associated with changes in specific growth-rate (Fig. 1A, [@Hanegraaf2001], [@Herbert1961], [@Makino2003]). To grow, microbial cells require several macromolecules and metabolites with unique elemental composition ([@Vrede2004], [@Franklin2011]) that transforms consumed substrates into various cell components. Typical example of macromolecule mediating growth is ribosomal RNA, which performs translation of genetic code into a sequence of amino acids. Because the rate of translation per unit of one ribosome is constant, increase in growth rate can be achieved only by increasing the ribosomal RNA content ([@Vrede2004], [@Franklin2011]). For that reason, ribosomal RNA content typically increases with increasing specific growth-rate (Fig. 1A, [@Hanegraaf2001], [@Makino2003], [@Herbert1961]).

To describe the relationship between the growth-rate and cell composition, it proved convenient to distinguish at least two pools of cellular biomass (Fig. 1B, [@Hanegraaf2001], [@Franklin2011]). One pool represents all cell constituents that are typically present in non-growing cell. The second pool represents the macromolecules and metabolites whose content increases with increasing growth rate ([@Hanegraaf2001], [@Franklin2011]). The terminology is not unified in respect to these pools. [@Hanegraaf2001] for example, denote these pools as "Structures" and "Reserves", respectively. [@Franklin2011] use the terms "baseline biomass" and "growth machinery" (authors also distinguish the third pool of "uptake machinery"). For convenience and in line with the soil microbiology text books, we will hereafter use the terms "Basal biomass" ($B$) and "Growth intermediates" ($G$). As the specific-growth rate increases, relative abundance of $B$ decreases whereas $G$ increases. Defining the macromolecular content and/or elemental stoichiometry of pools $B$ and $G$ allows then to associate changes in cell composition directly to changes in specific-growth rate ([@Hanegraaf2001], [@Hanegraaf2000]).

Soil microbial communities are characteristic by an occurance of many species, thousands per gram of dry soil [citace]. Given the fact that each microbial species
